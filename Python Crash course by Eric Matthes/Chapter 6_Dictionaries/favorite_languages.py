When you know you’ll need more than one line to
define a dictionary, press ENTER after the opening brace.
Then indent the next line one level (four spaces) and write
the first key-value pair, followed by a comma. From this
point forward when you press ENTER, your text editor
should automatically indent all subsequent key-value pairs
to match the first key-value pair

Once you’ve finished defining the dictionary, add a closing
brace on a new line after the last key-value pair, and indent
it one level so it aligns with the keys in the dictionary. It’s
good practice to include a comma after the last key-value
pair as well, so you’re ready to add a new key-value pair on
the next line.

Most editors have some functionality that helps you
format extended lists and dictionaries in a similar
manner to this example. Other acceptable ways to
format long dictionaries are available as well, so you
may see slightly different formatting in your editor, or
in other sources.
