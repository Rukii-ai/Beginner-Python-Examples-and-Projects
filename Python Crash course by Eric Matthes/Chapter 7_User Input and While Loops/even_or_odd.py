"""
A useful tool for working with numerical information is the
modulo operator (%), which divides one number by another
number and returns the remainder.

The modulo operator doesn’t tell you how many times one
number fits into another; it only tells you what the
remainder is.

When one number is divisible by another number, the
remainder is 0, so the modulo operator always returns 0.
You can use this fact to determine if a number is even or
odd
