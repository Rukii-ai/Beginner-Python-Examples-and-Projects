The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Beautiful is better than ugly

Simple is better than complex.
If you have a choice between a simple and a complex
 solution, and both work, use the simple solution. Your code
 will be easier to maintain, and it will be easier for you and
 others to build on that code later on.

Complex is better than complicated.
Readability counts.

Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. 
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

As you continue to the next chapter and start digging into
 more involved topics, try to keep this philosophy of
 simplicity and clarity in mind. Experienced programmers will
 respect your code more and will be happy to give you
 feedback and collaborate with you on interesting projects
