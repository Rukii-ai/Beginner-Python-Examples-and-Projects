"""
Skilled programmers expect to see
 comments in code, so it’s best to start adding descriptive
 comments to your programs now. Writing clear, concise
 comments in your code is one of the most beneficial habits
 you can form as a new programmer.
 When you’re deciding whether to write a comment, ask
 yourself if you had to consider several approaches before
 coming up with a reasonable way to make something work;
 if so, write a comment about your solution. It’s much easier
 to delete extra comments later than to go back and write
 comments for a sparsely commented program.
