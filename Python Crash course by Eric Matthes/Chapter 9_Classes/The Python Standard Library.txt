The Python standard library is a set of modules included
with every Python installation. 

Let’s look at one module, random, which
can be useful in modeling many real-world situations.
One interesting function from the random module is
randint(). This function takes two integer arguments and
returns a randomly selected integer between (and including)
those numbers.

Here’s how to generate a random number between 1 and
6:
>>> from random import randint 
>>> randint(1, 6) 
3

Another useful function is choice(). This function takes in a
list or tuple and returns a randomly chosen element:
>>> from random import choice 
>>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli'] 
>>> first_up = choice(players) 
>>> first_up 
'florence'

The random module shouldn’t be used when building
security-related applications, but it works well for many fun
and interesting projects.

NOTE
You can also download modules from external sources.

One excellent resource for exploring
the Python standard library is a site called Python Module of the Week. Go to
https://pymotw.com and look at the table of contents. Find a module that
looks interesting to you and read about it, perhaps starting with the random
module.
