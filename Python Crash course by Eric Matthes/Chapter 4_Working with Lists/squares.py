"""
A list comprehension allows you to generate 
this same list in just one line of code. A list comprehension combines the 
for loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically 
appends each new element. List comprehensions are not always presented 
to beginners, but I’ve included them here because you’ll most likely see 
them as soon as you start looking at other people’s code.
"""

square = [value**2 for value in range(1,11)]
print(square)

"""
To use this syntax, begin with a descriptive name for the list, such as 
squares. Next, open a set of square brackets and define the expression for 
the values you want to store in the new list. In this example the expression is 
value**2, which raises the value to the second power. Then, write a for loop 
to generate the numbers you want to feed into the expression, and close the 
square brackets.
"""

"""
It takes practice to write your own list comprehensions, but you’ll find 
them worthwhile once you become comfortable creating ordinary lists. 
When you’re writing three or four lines of code to generate lists and it 
begins to feel repetitive, consider writing your own list comprehensions.
